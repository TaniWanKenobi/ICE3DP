## 1/2/2026 3 PM - research  

_Time spent: 0.8h_  

so I want a corexy or smth with a stationary build plate

I was looking into PCBs and heated beds and whatnot, WAIT A SECOND I DONT NEED ONE!!! THIS IS ICING LMAOOO

icing seems to cool fast ash when constant cooling is applied

ok so this is the plan

Im going to make a 3dp with a 120x120 bed thats corexy. I dont entirely think levelign is needed but for polish ill add it bc why not, if I have time. since its a corexy, sheetcooling shouldnt be hard. ill have 2 5015 on the toolhead. toolhead will also be a syringe, driven by rack and pinion or whatever was in this video, it lowk seems more polished to me. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0dcF48U9k seems like a valid proof of concept, and with a corexy, this should be better.

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3487917, ill either be basing toolhead off of this or rack and pinion. 

I think ill do 150 ml, a solid 3x3 cube seems like its good!

Ill be working on my toolhead now, see u there :)

## 1/2/2026 8 PM - Created toolhead  

_Time spent: 5.0h_  

Im making a toolhead that can connect to lin rails

to make sure its acc 150 ML, 42.60000 mm d 147.79518 height mm, (42.6/2)^2*pi*147.79518 mm^3 => ml = 210653.825485 mm^3, 1ml = 1000mm^3, 210.653825485 ml is good yayy

https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255800576028509.html 100 mm rails are good with MGN12 

The main goal of making this so tiny is to print everythign on my ender 3 LOL

1.17336 center distance

https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256802773736204.html for lead screw, ill do 150

nvm I use https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805576723890.html

due to screw issues, I decided to make this toolhead attachement

I added a wall so the toolhead dont slide off

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Njg2MjgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--6788049bad32c9a798a5e33441cd319fa13bd093/image.png)

https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255799990666860.html coupler

width of my toolhead = 65.36452+150= I need a 220 rail

YAY I finish toolhead, only took me 5 hours

TLDR:

Based off the tube I made the plunger:

based off that I made the outer gantry

and thats done!

  

## 1/3/2026 12 AM - Basic Gantry work  

_Time spent: 2.5h_  

so I did a bunch of thinking on the gantry

for stabilization, x gotta be dual mgn12 so im doing 2040 vertical, looks ugly but it is what it is

attached is the belt path!

## 1/3/2026 4:22 PM - I made the x gantry mounts  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzA2NTgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--42f9cdaab100a202063b94abbba90b623dc20087/image.png)

Ill add a self-threading m3 hole here

like I said before, I need 2040 here bc the toolhead is gigantic, 

GAHHHH N0OOOO I CAN MAKE IT A 2020 AND JUST HAVE THE OTHER ONE ON TOP WHAT AM I DOING

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzA3NTAsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--291471bbab4e6e3a1bb505dc36bb8ff1c2535229/image.png)

THEY INTERSECT ANYWAY




  

## 1/3/2026 4:25 PM - ok nvm  

_Time spent: 0.1h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzA3NTcsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--f0531cb03733078d9f128557bc26b2ccbdcac020/image.png)

since it goes out, it would intersect anyway. Im going to stick with 2040 to have 2 rails then. that sucks noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo well yes but no its less polished but now less cad work idek dude
  

## 1/4/2026 - I made the other 2 mounts kinda, they drafted  

_Time spent: 6.7h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzMxNTEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--348a832a0816d54f18b75d39e503b95be7e82ece/image.png)

I made a rough sketch (attached)
I also have the toolhead (attached, im going to add 5015 cooling
For the bed, my plan is to make a bed that I can add a thin sheet of aluminim to or something similar


![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzMxODUsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--b9a4749376b8770860dc791bb373e8b1ca692884/image.png)

I also modified my toolhead
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzMxODYsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--3ca39c0eadbffa3b7cb940b40193645f51358cca/image.png)

added support so its now supporioted in 3 places, and the top part is more stable. 

  

## 1/5/2026 - frame size  

_Time spent: 3.5h_  

210653.825485 mm^3 being extruded out a 4.44747 diam = abt 14 meters. Id say 2.0 mm ish per layer is reasonable?

ANYWAY

158.84518-35.00000 = at least 125 mm even with no z length. Lets just make it a square gantry :) thats 250 again,

https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0967P4DXJ5/p1767652038270869

gooahh

ok I did a shit ton of research and thinking, im going to do smth similar to a trident except add something like from the Monolith 0 to the bottom. My BOM should prob be really low :huzzah

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzQ2MjksInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--c1a108123914a963bace23a0dae8fe6c9c8f0fa4/image.png)

I made some of the frame and ya

## 1/8/2026 6 PM - Made Lower Bracket (yesterday)  

_Time spent: 6.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzQ2NjcsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--f866a1fc5ca0e22509e67922ef1f2d68e6fb724f/image.png)

lower bracket


NOO I should put it on the bottom

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzg0NTIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--80396a776907457a9ae9de8586881f51d42b7a99/image.png)


OK so I changed from triple z to dual z with the nuace that removing prints will be hell, but I think its good for budget


  

## 1/8/2026 9 PM - Add bed assembly and polish up top n bottom!  

_Time spent: 5.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzg1ODQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--584cc9a4171dc7db942daf7edfeb33b9df516c92/image.png)


I added the bed assembly.

to do this, I calculated the distance from extrusion to lead, I then made the assembly for the linear rails and lead screw, calculated that 150 indeed is good, and put that in  

## 1/10/2026 - make assembly and make ducts, fixed minor uisues  

_Time spent: 5.0h_  

1. I revizsed the plate dimensions and redid the bed (although it looks similar, dimensions a4re different)
2. I added ducts for sheetcooling
3. I crosschecked the design!

## 1/11/2026 4 PM - PSU  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805101944097.html? Fan = https://www.amazon.com/Wathai-Brushless-Cooling-Centrifugal-Airflow/dp/B07RMJC9NT/ is the cheapest I can find from ali or amazon 12.3 watts * 2
2.1 A

48 mm nema 17 = https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256801583088255.html $41.52. According to https://www.tinytronics.nl/product_files/004446_17HS8401_stepper_motor.pdf, thats 1.7 A, 1.7*4A = 6.8 A 

Heatbed = https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256801715397979.html, 20.33. 60W +/8 percnt =65 watt,  5.5 A



rpi 02w research voltage source: https://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/2025/12/01/raspberry-pi-power-supply-guide/#:~:text=Table_title:%20Comparison%20Table:%20Raspberry%20Pi%20Power%20Supply,Recommended%20Solution:%20Standard%201.2A%20Micro%2DUSB%20supply%20%7C

5V×3A=15W,	 15W/(12V×0.85)≈1.5A 

LM2596 seems to be a really good and cheap buck converter. https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808348795887.html?


btt wont be much either, so adding them up with some headroom

Made wiring diagram + feet



  

## 1/11/2026 5 PM - FINISHED THE PRINTER  

_Time spent: 5.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODExMjQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--edbbd71194adbc9978ce81012a5ce07f1d2c58b3/image.png)

I finished the feet, assembled everything in an actual assembly, fixed some design issues, recolored, added feet for the motors, and yeah everything's finished yay

I also made my BOM  

## 1/12/2026 - Repo Finished!  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

I made my readme and added all the files. William helped me with my renders! I also sanity checked it again to make sure everything is perfectly functional, and it is!
